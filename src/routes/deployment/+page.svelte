  <p>
    This is where the fun really starts. Certificates are created in AWS. Go to <a
      href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1"
      target="_blank"
      >us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1</a
    >, click "Services" in the upper left hand corner or search for and click
    certificate manager.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click "Request"</li>
    <li>Request a public certificate > Next</li>
    <li>Enter your domain name (e.g. example.com)</li>
    <li>
      Click "Add another name to this certificate" and add the wildcard (eg:
      *.example.com) (this is to cover any subdomains)
    </li>
    <li>Click "Request"</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This certificate then needs to be added to the DNS. We primarily use
    namecheap for our domain purhases and DNS management. The instructions below
    are for namecheap, but occassionally the DNS is managed in Route53 (AWS) or
    sadly even ðŸ’©GoDaddyðŸ’©.
